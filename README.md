### APK Explorer & Editor, an open-source tool to explore the contents of an installed APK, is strictly made with an aim to inspect an installed APK file.

### This is an experimental fork. The goal is to add support for decompiling apps into Java source code using [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) as a library.

## Features
AEE currently supports the following tasks
* Explore an installed application and navigate through its contents.
* Save/export individual resource files such as icon, fonts, graphics, binary XML files, etc to device storage.
* Export and easily manage (install, share etc.) APK's/Split APK's into device storage.
* Includes a feature-rich APK/Split APK/App bundle installer (easily pick and install files from device storage)
* It is also possible to edit text/binary XML files using an in-built text editor (disabled by default in the <b>Settings</b> menu).
* Delete or replaces resources.
* Assemble modified smali files into new classes (.dex).
* Create signed APK's/App Bundles after the above-mentioned processes.
* Resign APK's/bundles with AEE custom key.
