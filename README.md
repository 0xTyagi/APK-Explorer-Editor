### APK Explorer & Editor, an open-source tool to explore the contents of an installed APK, is strictly made with an aim to inspect an installed APK file.

## How-To-Use
AEE currently supports the following tasks
* Explore an installed application and navigate through its contents (single click).
* Save/export individual resource files such as icon, graphics, text files, etc.
* Very basic editing, only on text files at this moment.
* Delete resources (likely dangerous).
* Create signed APK's/App Bundles after the above-mentioned processes.
* Resign APK's/bundles with AEE custom key (long click).
* Install exported & resigned Split APK's
* Share an exported & resigned APK (long click).
